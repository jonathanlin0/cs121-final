# Supermarket Data Analysis and Inventory Management System

## Overview
This application helps supermarket analysts and managers optimize inventory and track sales trends. It provides both a client-facing interface for data analysis and an admin interface for managing inventory and stock updates.

## Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have the following:
- **Python 3.10** (This system was only tested on Python 3.10, and functionality is not guaranteed on other versions.)
- **MySQL Server**
- **Required Python Packages**: Install dependencies using:
  ```bash
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- **Dataset**: The data, which has been precleaned (from original Kaggle format)
  is in csv format in the `data/` folder. No further data cleaning will be necessary


Since we are using CSV files for data import, enter MySQL with:
```bash
sudo mysql --local-infile=1
```

## Database Setup
To set up the database, run the following SQL commands in order:
```sql
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS final;
CREATE DATABASE final;
use final;
source setup.sql;
source load-data.sql;
source setup-passwords.sql;
source grant-permissions.sql;
source setup-routines.sql;
source queries.sql;
```


## Running the Application
### Admin Interface
To start the admin application, run:
```bash
python3 app_admin.py
```
Admin users can:
- Add new orders
- Add new products

### Client Interface
To start the client application, run:
```bash
python3 app_client.py
```
Client users can:
- Query popular products
- Query popular aisles
- View customer order history

## Expected User Flow
1. A user (either admin or client) launches the application.
2. The system prompts for login credentials.
3. Upon successful authentication:
   - **Clients** can query supermarket sales data.
   - **Admins** can manage inventory.
4. The user selects an option from the menu and interacts accordingly.
5. The user can continue interacting or exit the system.

## Security & Permissions
- Clients have **read-only** access.
- Admins have **full control** over inventory and product modifications.
- Authentication is enforced before accessing any features.
