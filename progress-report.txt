- rename products_in_order to smt diff. delete card order, just make timestep per order
- rename `reordered` to `is_reordered` (ended up deleting since this can be derived)
- modify the data given to add our artificial time stamps, so then we can derive `add_to_card_order` (and other attributes) instead of having it built in. easier to maintain and scalable. more resistant to corrupt data
- make order timestamp allow null (in case handwritten data doesn't have enough detail that includes timestamp)
- chop out `reordered` since it can be derived
- `days_since_prior_order` is also derived (so remove)
- add store_id and stores concept
- remove derived data (dow, hour of day)
- break down app.py into app_client.py and app_admin.py
- separate users on sql and python level
